			<h2 class="job1"> <span class="job">Job #1:</span> Computer Science Tutor in the CSLC </h2>
			
			<p class="job1paragraph"> The first Computer Science job I had was being a tutor in the CSLC (Computer Science Learning Center) where I would help
			out computer science students at UW-Madison with programs and teaching general programming concepts in primarily Java but additionally Python and C
			My dedication to the students and ability to explain complicated concepts while tutoring was recognized by the professor who runs the CSLC which is 
			how I got the job as the Peer Mentor for CS400!</p>

			<p class="CSbuilding"> The CSLC has been recognized by the department in an article you can see <a href="http://ls.wisc.edu/news/cs-learning-center-boosts-student-success-through-peer-to-peer-assistance"> here </a> </p>
			
			<h2 class="job2"> <span class="job">Job #2:</span> Lead Instructor at iD Tech/Summer Internship </h2>
			<p class="job2paragraph"> Over the summer, I was an instructor for a small group of female students to introduce concepts in Artificial Intelligence through a Cozmo robot and programming in Python as
			well as an introductory VEX robotics course with programming in Modkit and C++. The young women worked on projects that both showed off their programming skills and their passion for making the world
			a better place. One example of a project was one student created a minigame where her robot drives up to objects and has people guess whether an object is recyclable or not. Another student had her robot
			create a home out of blocks and inform people about homelessness.</p>
